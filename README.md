The following project attemps to identify whether exists a relationship between suicides and gdp per capita. The analysis encompasses data gathered from 1985 to 2015 and coming from a broad number of countries throught the world.

Original dataset might be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016

As a conclusion, it was determined that gdp per capita has no effect on the number of suicides in countries from Asia, Europe and Ocenia. Countries from North and South America however, show a different picture. We can see a direct relationship between these two variables.

Flat lines suggest that a variation in gdp per capita wont affect the amount of suicides, while a upward tilted line reads into a directly proportional link
